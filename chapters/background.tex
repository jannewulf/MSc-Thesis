\chapter{Background}
% NOTE: Assume that the reader has common computer science knowledge!
In this chapter we are introducing knowledge which is required to understand the content of this thesis.
In \cref{sec:bg:compilers} we give an overview about how a compiler is typically implemented and which problems it has to solve that we want to tackle.
\todo{explain also the other sections}

\section*{Motivation?}
\cite{goodman1988code} state the important interdependence between instruction scheduling and register allocation.

\section{Compilers}
\label{sec:bg:compilers}
%What is a compiler? \\
% \todo{This is probably too basic and not required. Might maybe be used in introduction, though}
% In the early days of computer programming, computers were programmed in assembly languages.
% These languages are exclusive to specific processor architectures and only provide the instructions that are available by the \ac{isa} of the processor.
% This approach has several disadvantages.
% Lots of complicated code, that is hard to understand, is written to express even simple programs.
% Also, each program has to be rewritten to execute on a processor with another architecture.
%
% Nowadays computers are programmed---almost exclusively---in high-level programming languages like C/C++, Java, Python, etc.
% The processor is not able to execute code written in such high-level programming languages, though.
% For this reason a compiler has to translate the code into a format that the processor can understand.
Making computer programs, written in high-level programming languages, executable on a specific machine is not a trivial task.
Compilers are only one piece in the tool-chain required to make a program executable.
The compiler translates the high-level language into assembly language, which is translated into object code by the assembler.
Basic functionality like allocating memory or outputting strings on the screen is implemented in a standard library.
The object code of the standard library and potentially other libraries are linked together with the translated program by the linker.

%Why are compilers important? \\
The pure translation of the program is only one of the tasks a compiler has to fulfill.
